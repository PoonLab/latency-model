The rows and columns of the kernel matrices correspond to trees
simulated using different model parameters.

The first 10 trees use the base model parameters.

The next 10 trees have the first parameter of params.txt scaled
by 1.25.

The next 10 trees have the second parameter of params.txt scaled
by 1.25.

...

After that the next 10 trees have the first parameter scaled by
0.75.

Then the next 10 trees have the second parameter scale by 0,75.
